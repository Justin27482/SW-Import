# SW-Import

First of all I am standing on the shoulders of giants.  Thanks pelwar, Aaron and anyone else who's code went into this before I got my hands on it!  I took pelwar's statblock importer and adjusted to use objects and array's.  I also adjusted all the attributes to be compatible with this Official Savage Worlds sheet.

Current Version is 1.0.5

Currently it should do the following:

Read any SWADE Statblock placed in the GM Info section of a token and then:

Create Character Sheet
Import Attributes
Import Skills
Import Special Abilities (Also applies any consistant skill/stat/etc modifier)
Import Edges (Also applies any consistant skill/stat/etc modifier)
Import Hinderances (Also applies any consistant skill/stat/etc modifier)
Calculate and adjust Derived stats
Calculate modifiers due to:
  Special Abilities
  Edges
  Hinderances
Set Token used as Default Token
Set Token Image as Character Avatar Image
Add Weapons to the sheet


Next Tasks:
Processing Powers and adding to sheet in repeating section
